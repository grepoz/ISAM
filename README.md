# ISAM (indexed sequential access method)

I am presenting to You my approach to ISAM. 

ISAM (indexed sequential access method) is a method for creating, maintaining, and manipulating computer files of data so that records can be retrieved sequentially or randomly by one or more keys. Indexes of key fields are maintained to achieve fast retrieval of required file records in Indexed files.
